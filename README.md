●	Documentation: I was planning to do a employee report system but after starting the work i decided to do a note/reminder app . In this app you are able to write a reminder or a note for any kind of event by adding the event , date of the event and some extra details.

To run the application if you don't have installed node.js first of all you must download it from ( https://nodejs.org/en/download ) for your pc also download json packages in the terminal , type (npm init -y) and (npm i express express-validator pug body-parser nodemon) commands in the terminal to install the packages , after installing type ( npm run dev ) in the terminal to start the application.

There are no more any application dependencies’ have been used
